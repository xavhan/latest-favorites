## what is it?

This experiment aims to display my 50 most recent liked tracks on Spotify. The current state of the Spotify API makes it challenging to do so in a straightforward way.

## dev

Add a SPOTIFY_OAUTH_TOKEN in a `.env.local` file then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Browse [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
